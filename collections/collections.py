# collection are built-in datastructure in python 
# there are many types of collections 
# these collections used for storing data 
# Now we discuss four common types of collections 
# 1 is list 
# 2 tuple 
# 3 dictionaries 
# 4 set



# now only we show examples of these data structre we will explain more one by one in our next videos 




# LIst 


list_of_names =['Ali','Akhlaq','Tanveer']


# how to print these names 


# for name in list_of_names :
#     print(name)






# Tuple


_tuples = ('Akhlaq', 'Ali','Tanveer')


# for name in _tuples:

#     print(name)



# we were not saved ctr+s so it gave us error



# next is Dictionaries 


dic = {'name':'Akhlaq','age':25 , 'city':'jampur'}


# dictionaries contain  collections of two element one is key and one is value

# for key , value in dic.items():


#     print(key , value)




# Sets data structure in python 


sets = {'ali','akhlaq','tanveer'}


for etem in sets:

    print(etem)
