# list is a built in data structure in python 


# let start how to use list 


names = ['Akhlaq' , 'Huzaifa' , 'Ali']


# access any one element from list 


# nam3=names[2]

# nam1=names[0]

# print(nam3)

# print(nam1)




# add a new element at the end of list 


# names.append("Tanveer")


# nam4 = names[3]

# print(nam4)



# find the length of a list 



# length = len(names)

# print(length)



# how we can print all names using for loop 


# for loop is more easy to use than other languages


# you can replace an element with new one 

names[2]="Shams"


for nam in names:

    print(nam  , len(nam))


    # bcz a string element basicaly a list of char so it has length
